Currently working on adding documentation to everything. Stopped at AliasedType.

* Finish the "Bullseye IR to Dart" compiler. Add some more IR's eventually. Just
    keep looking at existing Dart code until *most* everything has an IR.
* Then do the AST. And then, the lexer + parser.
* And then, fix the docs on stuff.
* And then, once it's presentable, make a *small* site.
* And then, post on Reddit...
