# bullseye-lang
A pure functional language that compiles to Dart.

This project has been revived (it had been dead since 2019), but is still very
much a work in progress. There is nothing you can run just yet, as I'm focused
on creating, testing, and documenting the type system at this point.

## Contributing
This repository isn't in a presentable state right now, but if you're
interested in getting involved, contact me.

You are likely a good fit if one of the following statements is true:
* You've always wanted to make a compiler
* You like Dart a lot
* You're enthusiastic about functional programming
